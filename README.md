SaaS platform where users can generate ad creatives by uploading two images (a product and a model) and providing a short description. The platform uses Gemini for AI-driven generation, combined with a production-focused full-stack architecture.

This project is pushing me beyond CRUD into real SaaS concerns such as authentication, authorization, error monitoring, and scalable API design.

Stack & tooling:

Frontend: React

Backend: Node.js, Express

Database: PostgreSQL (PERN stack)

AI model: Gemini

Authentication & authorization: Clerk

Error monitoring: Sentry

I’m intentionally treating this as a SaaS-style product — focusing on user management, reliability, and real-world deployment considerations.
